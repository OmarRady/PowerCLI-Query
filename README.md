# PowerCLI-Query
lookup servers list in vCenter seeking responsible username or decommission date assigned to the server. Enabling us to update our users excel sheet straight away with huge time saving, although the output.xlsx file still needs to be double-checked manually due to non-patterned names values in vCenter. 

If the server doesn't exist in the vCenter then a message will be written out to PowerCLI terminal informing that, those will be excluded from the output excel sheet for further investigation.
